title: Say hello to my newest project, Coder Intros
---

[Coder Intros](https://coderintros.com/) is a website that publishes brief, daily
interviews with professional coders from all around the world. The goal is to bring
exposure to coding by getting the know the people that know coding best, even though
many of them have a tendency to shy away from exposure.

So check it out! And if you support the mission, please like our [Facebook page](https://facebook.com/coderintros).
