I'm Ethan, and I'm currently working on [Coder Intros](https://coderintros.com/). In
the past, I've been the CTO or VP Engineering at [Independent Journal Review](https://ijr.com),
[Bold](http://bold.global) (co-founder), [America Rising](https://www.americarisingpac.org),
[Clear](https://www.heyclear.com) (co-founder), [Right to Rise PAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Rise),
[Hipster](http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/15/aol-snaps-up-hyper-local-photosharing-app-hipster/) (co-founder),
and [Honest](http://www.honest.com).

I've been coding for as long as I can remember, but before I became serious about it,
I spent several years in New York City and Los Angeles taking acting and improv
classes, working as a body double or an extra, and waiting tables and working at
Radio Shack. I dropped out of college 3 times, changed my major 4 times, and didn't
graduate until I was 25. But you know, [a lot of people go to college for 7 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOsQ2epsI2M&t=5s).

I was infamously [fired from a Presidential campaign](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-10/ethan-czahor-jeb-bush-s-new-cto-is-guilty-of-being-a-young-conservative)
because, years ago, I tweeted some jokes that weren't campaign-appropriate and said
some things on my radio show that lacked a certain finesse. I apologized profusely
and was thoroughly embarrassed, and even [made an app](https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/20/sorry-about-that-f-bomb/)
that would prevent my situation from happening to others.

But you know what? Looking back on it, some of my jokes were pretty funny (some were
sorely unfunny), and the awful terms that were used to describe me -- misogynist, racist,
bigot, etc. -- were/are so incredibly inaccurate, that I wish I would have stuck
up for myself more at the time. Oh well.

You can find me on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/e10jc) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/e10jc),
neither of which I really use, or if you really want to talk to me, email me at [ethan@czahor.com](mailto:ethan@czahor.com).
