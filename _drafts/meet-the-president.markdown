On April 18, 2014, I purchased one (1) Photo Line For Two ticket to a 
<a href="https://my.democrats.org/page/contribute/PaloAltoReceptionMay8?custom1=98870421" target="_blank">special event in Palo Alto</a> featuring President Obama. 
But then I had a change of mind, and decided it would be better to give the ticket to my startup and let them do something fun with it. 

However, due to campaign finance laws, I can't legally give the ticket to Ratify Inc., and they can't legally give the ticket to you.

I can tell you here, though, on my personal website, that if you win [Ratify's "Meet the President" contest](http://www.ratifyapp.com/contest), 
whose prize package consists solely of round-trip airfare and hotel accomodations, **I will personally gift you my ticket**. 
You'll still have to pass the Secret Service background check on your own; I can't provide any assistance with that matter. 

What I'm doing has absolutely nothing to do with President Obama himself, his party, or his policies, by the way. 
Respectfully, I don't care what my ticket recipient's political views are, as I'll give my ticket to a Republican just as soon as I'd give it to a Democrat. 

Also, what I'm doing has absolutely nothing to do with my opinion on campaign finance law. I just think it'd be great for someone not as fortunate as me to 
be able to meet the President, and I'm legally trying to accomplish that.

So I hope you [enter the contest](http://www.ratifyapp.com/contest)! And if you win, I hope you have a great time!
